## **Installation**

### Via Bash script

```sh
# Step 1: Download the script
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger/main/scripts/blackdagger-installer.sh -o blackdagger-installer.sh

# Step 2: Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x blackdagger-installer.sh

# Step 3: Run the script with sudo
sudo bash blackdagger-installer.sh

```
**Important Note:** Within the Blackdagger server, to access the GoTTY web terminal, you must manually start the `default-gotty-service` DAG found in the DAGs section. Blackdagger utilizes GoTTY for web terminal functionality, which, for security reasons, does not automatically start upon system initialization.


### Via Docker


```sh
# In Blackdagger repo run this commmands 
docker compose up 
# If docker compose does not work please try to docker compose build
#docker compose build
# You can access web terminal in http://127.0.0.1:8080
# Also You can access gotty web terminal http://127.0.0.1:8090 username: blackdagger password: blackdagger
# Do not forget run default-gotty-service dags in http://[::]:8080/dags/default-gotty-service .
```

### Via GitHub Release Page

Download the latest binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger/releases) and place it in your `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`).

#### **IMPORTANT:** 
In some YAMLs and/or processes that users want to run by using Blackdagger, `sudo` permission may be required. Therefore, users may need to configure a `sudo` permission before running them. Without this permission, process running, maintaining, stopping features and other Blackdagger features may encounter bugs. Below, you can find different options to configure `sudo` permission:

1. First and **suggested option** is adding user account to the /etc/sudoers file with NOPASSWD permissions, enabling them to execute sudo commands without needing to enter a password. This modification simplifies operations that require elevated privileges by removing the requirement to provide a password for each sudo command.

In the terminal, type the following command to open the sudoers file using a text editor:
```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers
```

Scroll down to the bottom of the sudoers file.
Add the following line, replacing "username" with the actual username of the user account you want to grant sudo privileges without a password:

```bash
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```
Save your changes and exit the editor. 


2. To have root privileges you can run Blackdagger with sudo:
```bash
sudo blackdagger start-all
```
But this will create **.blackdagger** folder in root user. It may cause python package issues and pip related problems.

3. To ensure continuous operation of the process on your system, simply create and execute the following script every minute via cron—no root account required:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
process="blackdagger start-all"
command="/usr/bin/blackdagger start-all"

if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep "$process" > /dev/null
then
    exit
else
    $command &
fi

exit
```

### Get Example YAMLs For Various Purposes
After the installation, you can use YAMLs that we created for various purposes. 
We created these YAMLs to help you about mechanisms you can use in Blackdagger and give you inspiration for creating your own YAMLs or modifying ours for your purposes.

For now, we have these categories of YAMLs:
* [Default](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-default): Default YAMLs that consist of general mechanisms that you can use in any YAML file, such as parallel job running and conditional mechanisms.
* [DevSecOps](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-devsecops): YAMLs that will help you to setup an environment and install common tools for DevSecOps, along with language specific YAML files that you can use to run DevSecOps processes on your projects.
* [CART](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackdagger-cart): YAMLs that will help you to prepare, plan and perform CART processes. We advise you to use these YAMLs in [Blackcart](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/blackcart) since there is a pre-configured environment and a whole arsenal for CART purposes.
* DevOps: TBU
* MLOps: TBU
* MLSecOps: TBU

After installing Blackdagger, you can download these YAMLs by their categories by running the command:
```bash
# Categories: mlops, default, devsecops, devops, mlsecops, cart
blackdagger pull <category>
```

This command pulls YAML files from our repositories that you can find above. We created YAML files that are suitable with Blackdagger YAML format and useful for various cases. These YAML files are also tested many times to provide you a fast option to perform your desired actions.

## **Example Workflow**

This example workflow showcases a data pipeline typically implemented in DevOps and Data Engineering scenarios. It demonstrates an end-to-end data processing cycle starting from data acquisition and cleansing to transformation, loading, analysis, reporting, and ultimately, cleanup.

![Details-TD](assets/images/Demo.png)

The YAML code below represents this workflow:

```yaml
# Environment variables used throughout the pipeline
env:
  - DATA_DIR: /data
  - SCRIPT_DIR: /scripts
  - LOG_DIR: /log
  # ... other variables can be added here

# Handlers to manage errors and cleanup after execution
handlerOn:
  failure:
    command: "echo error"
  exit:
    command: "echo clean up"

# The schedule for the workflow execution in cron format
# This schedule runs the workflow daily at 12:00 AM
schedule: "0 0 * * *"

steps:
  # Step 1: Pull the latest data from a data source
  - name: pull_data
    command: "bash"
    script: |
      echo `date '+%Y-%m-%d'`
    output: DATE

 # Step 2: Cleanse and prepare the data
  - name: cleanse_data
    command: echo cleansing ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}.csv
    depends:
      - pull_data

  # Step 3: Transform the data
  - name: transform_data
    command: echo transforming ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_clean.csv
    depends:
      - cleanse_data

  # Parallel Step 1: Load the data into a database
  - name: load_data
    command: echo loading ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_transformed.csv
    depends:
      - transform_data

  # Parallel Step 2: Generate a statistical report
  - name: generate_report
    command: echo generating report ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_transformed.csv
    depends:
      - transform_data

  # Step 4: Run some analytics
  - name: run_analytics
    command: echo running analytics ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_transformed.csv
    depends:
      - load_data

  # Step 5: Send an email report
  - name: send_report
    command: echo sending email ${DATA_DIR}/${DATE}_analytics.csv
    depends:
      - run_analytics
      - generate_report

  # Step 6: Cleanup temporary files
  - name: cleanup
    command: echo removing ${DATE}*.csv
    depends:
      - send_report
```

## **Motivation**

Legacy systems often have complex and implicit dependencies between jobs. When there are hundreds of cron jobs on a server, it can be difficult to keep track of these dependencies and to determine which job to rerun if one fails. It can also be a hassle to SSH into a server to view logs and manually rerun shell scripts one by one. blackdagger aims to solve these problems by allowing you to explicitly visualize and manage pipeline dependencies as a DAG, and by providing a web UI for checking dependencies, execution status, and logs and for rerunning or stopping jobs with a simple mouse click.

## **Why Not Use an Existing Workflow Scheduler Like Airflow?**

While there are numerous workflow schedulers like Airflow available, these often necessitate the authoring of DAGs through programming languages such as Python. For legacy systems with extensive job configurations, incorporating code in languages like Perl or Shell Script can already be a complex endeavor. Introducing an additional layer with such tools can further complicate maintainability. In contrast, BlackDagger is crafted for simplicity and usability, requiring no coding skills. This makes it a perfect fit for smaller projects looking for a straightforward, self-sufficient workflow management solution.


## **How It Works**

BlackDagger simplifies workflow management by operating as a standalone command-line tool, leveraging the local file system for data storage — eliminating the need for database management systems or cloud services. It enables the definition of DAGs in an intuitive, declarative YAML format, ensuring that existing programs can be seamlessly integrated without any modifications.
