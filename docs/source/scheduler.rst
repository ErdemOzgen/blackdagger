Scheduler
==========

To run DAGs automatically, you need to run the ``blackdagger scheduler`` process on your system. Also, you can use `cron expression generator <https://crontab.cronhub.io/>`_ for your scheduler calculation. 

Cron Expression
----------------

You can specify the schedule with cron expression in the ``schedule`` field in the config file as follows.

.. code-block:: yaml

    schedule: "5 4 * * *" # Run at 04:05.
    steps:
      - name: scheduled job
        command: job.sh

Or you can set multiple schedules.

.. code-block:: yaml

    schedule:
      - "30 7 * * *" # Run at 7:30
      - "0 20 * * *" # Also run at 20:00
    steps:
      - name: scheduled job
        command: job.sh

Stop Schedule
--------------

If you want to start and stop a long-running process on a fixed schedule, you can define ``start`` and ``stop`` times as follows. At the stop time, each step's process receives a stop signal.

.. code-block:: yaml

    schedule:
      start: "0 8 * * *" # starts at 8:00
      stop: "0 13 * * *" # stops at 13:00
    steps:
      - name: scheduled job
        command: job.sh

You can also set multiple start/stop schedules. In the following example, the process will run from 0:00-5:00 and 12:00-17:00.

.. code-block:: yaml

    schedule:
    start:
      - "0 0 * * *"
      - "12 0 * * *"
    stop:
      - "5 0 * * *"
      - "17 0 * * *"
    steps:
      - name: some long-process
        command: main.sh

Restart Schedule
----------------

If you want to restart a DAG process on a fixed schedule, the ``restart`` field is also available. At the restart time, the DAG execution will be stopped and restarted again.

.. code-block:: yaml

    schedule:
      start: "0 8 * * *"    # starts at 8:00
      restart: "0 12 * * *" # restarts at 12:00
      stop: "0 13 * * *"    # stops at 13:00
    steps:
      - name: scheduled job
        command: job.sh

The wait time after the job is stopped before restart can be configured in the DAG definition as follows. The default value is ``0`` (zero).

.. code-block:: yaml

    restartWaitSec: 60 # Wait 60s after the process is stopped, then restart the DAG.
    steps:
      - name: step1
        command: python some_app.py

Run Scheduler as a Daemon
-------------------------

The easiest way to make sure the process is always running on your system is to create the script below and execute it every minute using cron (you don't need ``root`` account in this way).

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    process="blackdagger scheduler"
    command="/usr/bin/blackdagger scheduler"

    if ps ax | grep -v grep | grep "$process" > /dev/null
    then
        exit
    else
        $command &
    fi

    exit

Configuration
--------------

If you need to place DAGs in a different location, set the ``BLACKDAGGER_DAGS`` environment variable to specify the directory of the DAGs.
