This repository consists of YAML files that are created to be used in Blackdagger tool. These YAML files are designed to perform basic and simple tasks and show you the basic format and mechanisms of Blackdagger YAML files. You can find the descriptions of each step in the YAML files.

Features Provided With Default YAMLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- An example of a basic workflow with a useful DAG structure
- The format of conditional YAML files
- An example for passing values between steps
- An example to show you the YAML stopper
- An example to show you how to write files
- Pulling desired YAMLs from our collection
- Running an example HTTP request and jq query to show you various modifiable parameters

This repository consists of YAML files that are created to be used in Blackdagger tool.

With these YAML files, we aim to provide you example CART actions that are easy to run and understand, show you the format and mechanisms of Blackdagger YAML files and give you inspiration and ideas to modify these files or create new ones for your CART needs. You can find the descriptions of each step in the YAML files.

Features Provided With CART YAMLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scanning targets for:
- XSS
- SSRF
- CORS Misconfiguration
- LFI
- Open Redirect vulnerabilities
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning with reconnaissance and testing accessibility

We will frequently update these YAMLs with support for more kinds of CART actions and abilities. Stay tuned!

Using These YAMLs in Blackcart
------------------------------
Specifically for CART and DevSecOps needs, we created Blackcart which is a powerful Docker container designed for Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART) and DevSecOps pipelines. It integrates a comprehensive suite of security tools into a containerized environment, enabling continuous security testing and proactive threat mitigation. Blackdagger is also integrated in Blackcart. Therefore, we advise you to use these YAML files in Blackdagger integrated in Blackcart to benefit from the Blackcart's features and perform your CART tasks easily.
